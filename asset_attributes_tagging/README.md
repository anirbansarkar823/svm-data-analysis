# README file containing the conventions used during the process.
## Instruction on work
1. create individual directories for each problem areas.
E.g. education, agriculture etc.
2. In the directories for each problem area put the files
related to assed tagging and name the files according to
the asset being tagged. E.g. ~it_vocational_training_center~,
~degree_college_upto_ug~, etc.
3. Follow the instructions below.
## Document structure
The documents should be structured as follows:
1. About the document: brief description of the content.
2. Attributes for scoring the asset: A complete list of
variables and their sub-paramters.
3. Overall score: scoring for asset.
4. Attribute scoring and the process: Scoring of attributes
and the thorough explaination of the process.

## Scoring plan
The scoring of the variables will be done as follows:
1. Scoring of sub-variables:  
The sub-variables will be score on a scale of 0 to 1. The
scoring will be based on the input of the questions and the
type of the questionare.

2. Scoring of the main-variables:
The main-variables will be scored on a scale of 0 to 100.
The scoring will be done combining the scores of each
sub-variable multiplied by some weight.

## Constraints on weights
We have not allocated the weights. That is for the expert
in social sciences to do. However, the equations are chosen
assuming the sub-variables contribute some fraction to the
total score. This fraction is decided by the weights assigned.

But, the following constraints are to be kept in mind when
assigning the weights.
1. The weights should be assigned in such a way that when
the individual sub-parameters are in their maximum assignable
score, the score of the variable should be its maximum
assignable score.
2. If the individual sub-parameters are in their minimum
assignable score, the score of the the score of the variable
should be its minimum assignable score.
