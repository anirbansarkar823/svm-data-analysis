# Conventions and Considerations

## Instruction on work
- create individual directories for each problem areas.
E.g. education, agriculture etc.
- In the directories for each problem area put the
files related to assed tagging and name the files according
to the asset being tagged. E.g. `it_vocational_training_center`,
`degree_college_upto_ug`, etc.
- Follow the instructions below.


## Document structure
The documents should be structured as follows:
- About the document: brief description of the content.
- Attributes for scoring the asset: A complete list of
variables and their sub-paramters.
- Overall score: scoring for asset.
- Attribute scoring and the process: Scoring of attributes
and the thorough explaination of the process.
- Comments and Suggestion: An overall and general comments
and suggestions regarding the questionare and analysis. However,
specific suggestions can be added to section of interest.


## Scoring plan
The scoring of the variables will be done as follows:
- Scoring of sub-variables: The sub-variables will be score
on a scale of 0 to 1. The scoring will be based on the input of
the questions and the type of the questionare.
- Scoring of the main-variables:
The main-variables will be scored on a scale of 0 to 100.
The scoring will be done combining the scores of each
sub-variable multiplied by some weight.


## Constraints on weights
We have not allocated the weights. That is for the expert
in social sciences to do. However, the equations are chosen
assuming the sub-variables contribute some fraction to the
total score. This fraction is decided by the weights assigned.

But, the following constraints are to be kept in mind when
assigning the weights.
- The weights should be assigned in such a way that when
the individual sub-parameters are in their maximum assignable
score, the score of the variable should be its maximum
assignable score.
- If the individual sub-parameters are in their minimum
assignable score, the score of the the score of the variable
should be its minimum assignable score.
